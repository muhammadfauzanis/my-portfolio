            An Informatics Engineering student who passionately pursues
            programming, especially in front-end web development, backend

            2024 Batch 1 as a Cloud Computing Distinction Graduate. I can use
            React.js or Next.js to build frontend applications, use Express.js
            to build backend systems, also build cloud infrastructure. I am
            always motivated to keep learning every day so that I can improve
            myself and be useful in any environment.
